# BashCatch

A simple utility script for capturing command output in Bash.

## Description

BashCatch provides a `catch` command that captures both stdout and stderr output from shell commands, redirects the output to a specified file, and optionally copies the output to your clipboard.

## Features

- Captures both stdout and stderr in a single file
- Preserves the original command's exit code
- Option to automatically copy output to clipboard
- Simple syntax that works with any command

## Usage

```bash
catch [-c|--clipboard] output_file.txt command [args...]
```

### Options

- `-c` or `--clipboard`: Copy the captured output to clipboard

### Examples

Basic usage:
```bash
catch output.txt ls -la
```

Capture output and copy to clipboard:
```bash
catch -c results.txt grep "error" log.txt
```
